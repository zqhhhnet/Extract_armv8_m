Driver for ocamlbuild.
This file is the main program of ocamlbuild. After the invocation of 'ocamlbuild', this file is executed. It contains the dependencies of the directory, as these dependencies are not calculated by ocamlbuild by default.
Note that every '_tags' files can be deleted and put in this file, by using directly a call to the API of ocamlbuild.
Finally, we can modify the behaviour of ocamlbuild, by writing an OCaml Turing-complete program here, as it is done for performing a symbolic link for example.
