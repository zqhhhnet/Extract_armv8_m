Test(s) for Coq backend.

This is not yet covered by into ktest.

Directories contain input as .k files,
along with the .v and .labeled_rules files that should
be produced by running 'compile --backend coq' on the .k file.

The rule output is sensitive to things like the numbers in generated
variable names which may change quite often, robust automation would
need to take that into account.
(Perhaps a robustly Ltac-automated Coq proof of equivalence with
a reference version).
